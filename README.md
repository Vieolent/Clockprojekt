This project is a clock that takes inputs from a clock module, a teperature sensor module and a button. It then uses these values to display the time onto a screen, the temperature onto a servo and both onto a neopixel ring. By displaying the time on a neopixel ring I mean that a light moves around the circle, one lap takes one minute. By displaying the temperature on the neopixel ring I mean that it lights up a certain amount of lights depending on the temperature. The temperature is the ammount of lights lit + 10 and the max temperature it can display is 34 degrees celsius. You can change whether it displays seconds or degrees by adding or removing a power source from pin 10. I have made it like this because the buttons I was using stopped working properly. There is however one functional button that, when pressed, turns the time back by an hour so that you are never late.
